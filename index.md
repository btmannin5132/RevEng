# Welcome to ECE39595!
Hello, and welcome to ECE39595, Applications of ECE through Reverse Engineering.

I am Ben Manning, the course instructor for ECE39595.

This is an experimental lab course. Experimental courses in academics are designed to explore innovative teaching methods, emerging topics, and new areas of study that are not yet part of the established curriculum.  The instructors of this course are grateful to the students that are willing to work with the instructors to develop this course as it is developed.

If you have further questions, please contact me at btmannin@purdue.edu. 

Thank you,

Ben Manning
