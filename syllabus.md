## Research Disclosure

This course will be the subject of research through the Elmore Family
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the school of
Engineering Education at Purdue University. This research is approved
through the Institutional Review Board (IRB 2024 -- 582), with Dr. Jason
Morphew as the Principal Investigator and Ben Manning as the
Co-Investigator. **Anonymous** data will be collected from students to
assess their development through the course, specifically focusing on
the student mindsets of ECE concepts and personal confidence with the
material.\
\
The purpose of the research is to evaluate the course activities and the
instructor. This means that students will not be asked to do anything
other than the regular course work for this class. In addition, all
identifying information, such as a student's name or student id, will
never be shared with anyone except the course instructor in compliance
with FERPA. This means that student performance in this class will
remain confidential.

## Course Policies

The section Graduate Instructor is responsible for assessing the quality
of your work and progress in the course. Ultimately they are responsible
for determining your semester grade.

To receive a passing grade, you must *at least*:

-   Attend **all** scheduled lab sections (unless excused by the
    instructor). Students must request an excused absence from the
    instructor **before** the scheduled sessions begin.

-   Perform all experiments.

-   Submit a complete journal write up for each lab.

-   Obtain an average of 60% or better between the project presentations
    and reports.

-   Effectively work with your partner(s) during the lab period.

Failing to complete any of the above criteria are grounds for failing
the course.\
**Food and drink other than water are prohibited** at all times in the
lab. Anyone with open food or drink in lab will be required to leave.
Water must be in a resealable container, and placed on the floor.

## Piazza

Any overreaching announcements, lab modifications, and assignment
adjustments will be announced through Piazza, an online forum where
students can ask questions, and instructors can post announcements. It
will be expected that students check the course Piazza page regularly to
make sure they stay up-to-date on the course. Email notifications can
also be added for when instructors make announcements. Students
initially enrolled in the course will be automatically populated into
the course Piazza page. If a student is added late, or was not
automatically populated into the page for whatever reason, they can join
the course Piazza page by going to
<https://piazza.com/purdue/spring2025/ece39595>.

## Assignments

### Lab Journal

Laboratory Journals should be a log of all your work performed in this
course. This notebook can be either digital or hand-written. **If you
start with either digital or handwritten it needs to be consistent
throughout the experiment.** The notebook should be updated in real time
during the experiment.

The lab notebook should focus on answering the below questions:

-   "What are we doing in this task?\"

-   "Why are we doing this task?\"

-   "How are we performing this task?\"

The above questions can generally be answered using the below procedure:

-   Give a brief context to where you are in the experiment.

-   Capture detailed results from experiment.

-   Give **quick/short** insights into why you think an outcome occurs.

-   All deconstructions will be expected to have a general SPICE
    simulation/schematic/flow diagram to help with the analysis.

The lab notebook is essential to success in this course. It should be
kept organized and neat to improve your effectiveness as researchers.
The notebook will be turned in digitally with the experiment.

### Reports 

There will be two projects that require a well-documented formal report
to be turned in. These documents will include in paragraph form:

-   An abstract

-   An introduction and conclusion to the overall problem and solution.

-   A theory section that explains how the system and its parts work.

-   Contains a discussion of the measurement results and conclusions
    made based on the results.

-   Has **only** electronically drawn schematics and typed equations

-   Answers all question in the experiments text

\
If preferred, the formal reports for this class can also be written as a
service manual/datasheet for the products that are being analyzed.
Please reach out to the instructor for more information.\
\
All Write-ups and reports need to completed in a word processor.
Hand-written or stylus-written write-ups will not be accepted, Any
hand-written or stylus-written component of the writeups and reports
will receive a score of 0 for that submission. This includes hand-drawn
schematics and figures.

### Presentations

Along with the project reports, Students will be expected to present
their projects in two formats. For the first project, this will be a
brief presentation to the class discussing the deconstruction and
analysis of the student's chosen product. The second presentation will
be a poster session open to the general public where students will
discuss their final project deconstruction and analysis.

### Weekly Reflections 

One of the main purposes of this course is to provide a space for
students to reflect on their learning, and how they will use the content
learned in personal projects and future applications. Students will
conduct a promoted weekly reflection where they will discuss what they
learned that week and where they see them using the content in the
future, or not using it for that matter.

## Due dates

### Journals and Reports

Write-ups and reports are due at 11:59pm of the day of your next lab,
skipping the first week of the semester. There will be a 20% deduction
for each 24 hours late, starting at 12:00AM the next day, including
weekends.

Late submissions for the final project report will not be accepted.

Lab reports turned in after midnight after the due date will be
considered late.

## Submission Policy 

It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that submissions into
the grading platform are on time and successful. If a student is having
issues submitting an assignment for whatever reason, they should reach
out to their Graduate Instructor in a timely manner to explain their
situation. Late submissions will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

## Regrades

Requests for regrades must be made within one week of the grade in
question being returned to the student, and 24 hrs. After grades have
been returned. Request made after this time will not be considered.

## Cheating

-   All work submitted must be the students own.

-   The student **may not** copy text or figures from the course manual.

-   Use of material from past semesters will be considered cheating.

All cases of cheating will result in a grade of **zero** on the
assignment. Offense(s) may result in failing the course. Cheating may
also be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students.

## Large Language Models/AI/Generative Models

As generative models continue to embed their uses into our regular
technologies, it would be a disservice to fully deny the use of the tool
in modern education. Instead, the discussion should revolve around using
the tools properly and ethically. The below concepts should be followed
when using generative models in this course:

Effective Usage:

-   Students are encouraged to use generative models to help brainstorm
    and organize thoughts. Especially for formal reports, generative
    models allow for multiple formats to be accessible in a short time
    period.

-   Students are NOT permitted to use generative models to analyze data.
    This is a task that is expected to fully fall to the student. This
    is different than helping visually present data, as generative
    models can quickly provide multiple different ways to visually
    present data. It is still up to the student to determine the best
    way to present the data.

Ethical Usage:

-   Students must be transparent where and how they use generative
    models in this course.

-   Students may not use AI/LLMs on their reflections.  These are not graded for spelling/grammar, instructors are only interested in the student's own thought process.

-   Students may generate up to 20% of a submission using generative
    models. This should be focused on formatting and thought collection.
    All data analysis must still be completed by the student.

-   Students must acknowledge where they use generative models in their
    writing using a reference note discussing the usage. A URL must also
    be provided to link to the prompts and outputs of the generative
    model. For example, the FAQ for ChatGPT link sharing can be found at
    <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq>.

-   Any writing or other submissions not explicitly identified as
    generated will be assumed as original to the student. Submitting
    generated work without identifying it as such will be considered a
    violation of Purdue's academic integrity policy, specifically the
    violation of "submitting a document written by someone else but
    representing it as one's own." As in any situation where a student
    is using writing from another person without correctly referencing
    the original author, this would be considered a form of plagiarism.

Generative models are still a developing technology, and how they are
implemented in educational settings is still a divided topic of
discussion, and can lead to grey areas on judgement. If a student is
unsure on how much of their document is artificially generated, or if
they are in violation of a policy, the student should reach out to Ben
Manning at least 48 hours before their submission due date to receive
guidance.

## Grade Breakdown

This course uses a weighted grade system. The weight of each section of
the final grade is listed below.
|Category|Weight|
|:---|:---|
|Journal Submissions| 50%|
|Weekly Reflections| 15%|
|Project Reports|  15%|
|Appliance Project Presentation|   10%|
|Final Project Poster Session|     10%|

The following grade cut-offs will be used in this course.

|Percentage Range| Grade||Percentage Range| Grade|
|:---|:---:|---|:---|:---:|
|$100\%>x\geq96\%$| A+*||$80\%>x\geq76\%$| C+|
|$96\%>x\geq93\%$| A||$76\%>x\geq73\%$| C|
| $93\%>x\geq90\%$| A-||$73\%>x\geq70\%$| C-|
|$90\%>x\geq86\%$| B+||$70\%>x\geq66\%$ |D+|
|$86\%>x\geq83\%$ |B||$66\%>x\geq63\%$| D|
|$83\%>x\geq80\%$| B-||$63\%>x\geq60\%$| D-|
| | ||$60\%>x$| F|

\* A+ Grades will still appear as an "A" on a transcript
## Course Expectations

### Preparing for Class

While there should be minimal work needed outside of the lab, students
should review the devices and appliances being discussed that week to
help move the lab forward efficiently.

### In Class

During lab you should perform each task of the experiment. Recording
your work in your lab notebook as you go. Your lab notebook is proof
that you performed the experiments.\
\
If you do not finish the experiment in class, you must complete it
before the beginning of the next week's experiment.

### After Class

After performing the experiment and gathering results, you will need to
analyze the results and draw conclusions. Analyzing data should be done
in tools such as MATLAB, Python NumPy, or any other numerical computing
applications to make plots and compare results.\
\
Your analysis should always compare theoretical calculations with
measured results and attempt to measure and describe the causes of
error.

### Office Hours

Ben will have office hours in ARMS 1224 on Wednesdays from 2-3pm.  Location may change later in semester.

Alex will have office hours in Potter B053 on Tuesdays from 3-4:30pm. Additional hours can be scheduled at request of students on Piazza or over email.

## Safety

There are several dangers that can be encountered in an electronics
laboratory. These include (but are not limited to):

-   Shock

-   Burns

-   Mechanical injury

-   Chemical exposure

Be aware of these potential dangers and make every effort to avoid them.
Violation of these rules may result in access privileges being revoked.
There are cameras in the lab and we will review them as needed.\
\
Lab instructors hold the responsibility of ensuring the lab is in a safe
working condition before the students use the area, and enforce proper
safety etiquette in the lab. If students are intentionally unsafe in the
lab, encouraging unsafe behavior, or are continuing unsafe behavior
after being told to cease the behavior, the student will be removed from
the lab, resulting in a failing grade for that week's lab. If multiple
occurrences of this behavior continue, more severe consequences can be
discussed. These additional consequences can include but are not limited
to:

-   Failing of the course

-   Reports to student advisor

-   Reports to campus and local law enforcement

### Equipment Safety

The benchtop equipment that is used in this lab is very expensive, and
can be damaged if not used properly. If a student is found intentionally
misusing the equipment, the same consequences can be issued as stated
above for unsafe actions in the lab in addition to putting a hold on a
student account until payment is made to replace any damaged equipment.\
\
It is recommended students use the provided desktop computer in the lab
when using the benchtop equipment. Students use their own personal
devices such as laptops at their own risk when using the benchtop
equipment. For example, If the final project is not made correctly,
there is a chance of surges flowing back to the computer through the
audio port of the computer, which can fry the audio port, motherboard
and power supply unit.
